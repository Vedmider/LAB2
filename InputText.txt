	The new boy went off brushing             the dust from his clothes, sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and threatening what he would do to Tom the 'next time he caught him out.' 
To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like an antelope.
Tom chased the traitor home, and thus                    found out where he lived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined.
At last the enemy's mother appeared,                   and called Tom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but he said he ''lowed' to 'lay' for that boy.
	He got home pretty late that night, and                      when he climbed cautiously in at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his Saturday holiday into 
captivity at hard labor became                      adamantine in its firmness.
					CHAPTER II
	SATURDAY morning was come,         and all the summer world was bright and fresh, and brimming with life. 
There was a song in every heart; and               if the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in every face and a spring in every step. 
The locust-trees were in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.
	Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket          of whitewash and a long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high.
Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a         burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far- reaching continent of 
unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree-box                 discouraged. Jim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom's eyes, before, but now it did not strike him so.
He remembered remembered remembered that there was company at the pump. White,                          mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting, skylarking.
